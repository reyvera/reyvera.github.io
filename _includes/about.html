                      &nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp From the beautiful, and sunny state
                      of California, only to be raised in Tulare county (think dairy cows
                      around every corner). Since agriculture was not a way of life for my family,
                      I knew my educational, and ultimately occupational, choices needed
                      be made based on the ability to adapt to any environement I may
                      find myself in.

                      &nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp As a child, I was enamored with the process of
                      problem solving, whether that be through playing with legos, or
                      taking apart  my mother's blender. Today, I can honestly admit that
                      I cared more about wanting to know how "things" work, rather than
                      how to put it back together. This determined the majority of my
                      education experience from grade-school, through univerisity. Loving
                      all areas of science, math, and history.

                      &nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp Ultimately leading to undergrad studies at CSU
                      Fresno (Go Bulldogs!) in Engineering, and Mathematics (with minor
                      in philosophy). During this time, I paid some of my tuition through
                      ethical hacking, web development, and tutoring in various subjects.
                      Taking full advantage of what the university had to offer, I often
                      found myself sitting-in on lectures I wasn't enrolled in, leading to
                      a greater understanding in advanced physics, and computer science topics.

                      &nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp Throughout the years, I have also found myself
                      enjoying the process of making music (in a literal sense). Spending
                      time mastering the bass guitar, then moving on to the electric/acoustic
                      guitar, it wasn't long until I began to adapt my curious nature towards
                      this love of music. This began the journey of designing, and constructing
                      electric guitars, and various effect pedals.
