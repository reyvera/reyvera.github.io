description: The COO/Creative Director of Storm Maker Media reached out for assistance on <a target="_blank" href="http://www.thefallseventcenter.com/">The Falls Event Center's</a> website. The original site was designed using WordPress as the platform, so the important consideration here was trying to keep as much of the functionality they were used to intact.
