        <description>The client wanted a site that could be completely self-maintained, while not compromising on it&#39;s ability to be feature rich. This led to the decision to use SquareSpace as the Content Management System. After deciding which platform to use, the default template &quot;Alex&quot; was used as a base with modifications to fit the clients exact needs. Specifically, there needed to be an easy way to add the clients logo image to the nav-bar, and home section; and the nav-bar needed to have a mobile variant when the screen size was small enough; and backend JavaScript was implemented to allow for a proper responsive design based on their needs.</description>

        <description>The COO/Creative Director of Storm Maker Media reached out for assistance on &lt;a target=&quot;_blank&quot; href=&quot;http://www.thefallseventcenter.com/&quot;&gt;The Falls Event Center&#39;s&lt;/a&gt; website. The original site was designed using WordPress as the platform, so the important consideration here was trying to keep as much of the functionality they were used to intact.</description>
